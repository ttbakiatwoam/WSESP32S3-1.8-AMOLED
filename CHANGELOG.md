## Revival v1.4.9

### ❤️ New Stuff

- Basic changeable SD Card pin out through webUI and serial command line (requires existing sd support to be enabled in your board's build)
- Added default evil portal html directly in the firmware (credit to @breaching and @bigbrodude6119 for the tiny but great html file)
- Basic congestion command to quickly see channel usage
- Added scanall command to scan aps and stations together

### 🤏 Tweaks and Improvements

- Simplified the evil-portal command line arguments.
  - eg. ```startportal <google.html> (or <default>) <EVILAP> <PSK>```
- Save credentials in flash when using connect command
- Captive portal now supports Android devices
- Simplified the evil-portal command line arguments.
- set LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS to 16 instead of 10
- Save captured evil-portal credentials to SD card if available
- Added support for scanning aps for a specific amount of time eg. ```scanap 10```
- Connect command now uses saved credentials from flash when no arguments are provided
- Added channel hopping to station scan
- Include BSSID in scanap output

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Use "GhostNet" as fallback default webUI credentials if G_Settings fields are not set or invalid
- Fix webUI not using evilportal command line arguments
- Fix evil‑portal local file serving 
- Correctly parse station/AP MACs and ignore broadcast/multicast in Station Scan
- Fix station scanning using wrong frame bit fields and offsetting the mac addresses
