[{"content":"Discover nearby BLE devices and gather information about them.\nPrerequisites\rGhostESP flashed device, powered on with a wireless antenna. Device must support Bluetooth (not available on ESP32-S2). Scanning for devices\rOn-device UI\rOpen Menu → Bluetooth. Choose a scanning mode from the options below. The device will start scanning. Leave it running until you have enough data. Back out of the terminal view to stop scanning. The device will show a summary of discovered devices. Command line\rOpen the GhostESP terminal. Run blescan [OPTION] where the option is one of the modes below (for example, blescan -f). The device will start scanning. Run blescan -s when you\u0026rsquo;re done. The device will stop scanning and show a summary. Scanning modes\rFind Flippers\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Find Flippers CLI: blescan -f Scans for nearby Flipper Zero devices and displays their names and signal strength. After scanning, use Select Flipper to track a specific device\u0026rsquo;s RSSI (signal strength) in real time as you move around. AirTag Scanner\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Start AirTag Scanner CLI: blescan -a Scans for Apple AirTags and other Find My devices using active scanning with aggressive parameters to maximize detection. Allows duplicate advertisements to be reported for better tracking. Use List AirTags to see discovered devices, or Select AirTag to prepare for spoofing. BLE Skimmer Detection\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → BLE Skimmer Detect CLI: capture -skimmer Scans for payment terminal skimmers that use BLE to exfiltrate card data. Logs detected skimmers to a PCAP file for analysis. Listing and selecting devices\rAfter scanning, you can interact with discovered devices:\nList discovered devices\rFlippers: Menu → Bluetooth → List Flippers or CLI: listflippers AirTags: Menu → Bluetooth → List AirTags or CLI: list -airtags Select a device for further action\rFlipper: Menu → Bluetooth → Select Flipper Once selected, the device will continuously track and display the Flipper\u0026rsquo;s RSSI (signal strength). Use this to locate the Flipper by moving around and watching the signal strength change. AirTag: Menu → Bluetooth → Select AirTag (prepares for spoofing) Notes\rBLE scanning is not available on ESP32-S2 devices. Scanning modes are mutually exclusive; starting a new scan will stop the previous one. Signal strength (RSSI) is displayed in dBm; higher values (closer to 0) indicate stronger signals. Some devices may not respond to all scanning modes depending on their BLE implementation. Troubleshooting\rNo devices found: Move closer to BLE devices and try scanning again. Scanning stops immediately: Check that your device has Bluetooth enabled, try turning the GhostNet AP off and rebooting to conserve memory. Device not responding: Some devices may be in sleep mode or have BLE disabled. Try scanning again or move closer. Bluetooth not supported: Ensure you\u0026rsquo;re using a device other than ESP32-S2, which does not have Bluetooth support.

Device must support Bluetooth (not available on ESP32-S2). Legal and ethical\rPatches and Mitigations\rBLE spam attacks have been largely patched in recent device updates:\niOS: Apple addressed the issue in iOS 17.2 and later with stability improvements and crash fixes. Android: Google patched BLE spam vulnerabilities in Android 14 and later. Windows: Microsoft has implemented protections in recent Windows versions. However, older devices and firmware versions remain vulnerable. These attacks are primarily useful for security research and testing on controlled devices.\nSafety Warnings\rDo not use BLE attacks in public or near other people. BLE spam can:\nCause nearby devices to crash or become unresponsive. Interfere with medical devices (pacemakers, insulin pumps, hearing aids, etc.) that rely on Bluetooth connectivity. Disrupt emergency communication systems. Cause unexpected behavior in connected vehicles and smart home systems. Violate local regulations regarding electromagnetic interference. Only use these features:\nIn isolated test environments with devices you own or have explicit permission to test. For authorized security research and penetration testing. With full understanding of the legal implications in your jurisdiction. BLE Advertisement Spam\rBroadcast fake BLE advertisements to simulate nearby devices.\nOn-device UI\rOpen Menu → Bluetooth → Spam. You should see the spam options. Choose a spam type from the options below (for example, BLE Spam - Apple). The device will start broadcasting advertisements. Leave it running as long as you want. Select Stop BLE Spam to stop broadcasting. The device will show a summary of packets sent. Command line\rOpen the GhostESP terminal. Run blespam [TYPE] where the type is one of the modes below (for example, blespam -apple). The device will start broadcasting. Run stop when you\u0026rsquo;re done. The device will stop and show a summary. Spam modes\rApple Device Spam\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Spam → BLE Spam - Apple CLI: blespam -apple Broadcasts fake Apple device advertisements (AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, AirTags, etc.). Uses Apple\u0026rsquo;s Continuity Protocol with randomized device types and colors. Nearby Apple devices may show pairing prompts or connection notifications. Microsoft Swift Pair Spam\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Spam → BLE Spam - Microsoft CLI: blespam -ms or blespam -microsoft Broadcasts fake Microsoft device advertisements with random device names. Targets Windows devices with Swift Pair notifications. Samsung Device Spam\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Spam → BLE Spam - Samsung CLI: blespam -samsung Broadcasts fake Samsung Galaxy Watch and other Samsung device advertisements. Targets Android devices with Samsung pairing prompts. Google Fast Pair Spam\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Spam → BLE Spam - Google CLI: blespam -google Broadcasts fake Google device advertisements using Google\u0026rsquo;s Fast Pair protocol. Targets Android devices with Google pairing notifications. Random Spam\rUI: Menu → Bluetooth → Spam → BLE Spam - Random CLI: blespam -random Cycles through all spam types (Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Google) randomly. Broadcasts a mix of different device types to maximize disruption. AirTag Spoofing\rSpoof Apple AirTags and other Find My devices to broadcast their location. This makes your device appear as a legitimate AirTag to nearby Apple devices.\nWorkflow\rScan for AirTags\nOpen Menu → Bluetooth → AirTag → Start AirTag Scanner or run blescan -a. Wait for the scan to complete. List discovered AirTags\nOpen Menu → Bluetooth → AirTag → List AirTags or run list -airtags. You should see a list of discovered AirTags with their index numbers. Select an AirTag to spoof\nOpen Menu → Bluetooth → AirTag → Select AirTag. Enter the index number of the AirTag you want to spoof. Start spoofing\nOpen Menu → Bluetooth → AirTag → Spoof Selected AirTag or run spoofairtag. The device will broadcast as the selected AirTag. Nearby Apple devices will see your device as that AirTag. Stop spoofing\nOpen Menu → Bluetooth → AirTag → Stop Spoofing or run stopspoof. The device will stop broadcasting the AirTag advertisement. Notes\rBLE attacks are not available on ESP32-S2 devices. Spam attacks and spoofing are mutually exclusive; starting one will stop the other. The device broadcasts continuously until you explicitly stop it. Spam packet counts are logged every 5 seconds to the terminal. Apple spam uses different advertising intervals (~100ms) than other spam types for better compatibility. Spoofing captures the full AirTag advertisement payload during scanning for accurate reproduction. Troubleshooting\rAttacks not working: Check that your device has Bluetooth enabled and sufficient free memory. Try turning off the GhostNet AP and rebooting to conserve memory. No AirTags found: Move closer to Apple devices with Find My enabled or try scanning again. Spoofing doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear on Apple devices: Ensure you\u0026rsquo;ve selected a valid AirTag before starting spoofing. Try stopping and restarting the spoof. Bluetooth not supported: Ensure you\u0026rsquo;re using a device other than ESP32-S2, which does not have Bluetooth support.
