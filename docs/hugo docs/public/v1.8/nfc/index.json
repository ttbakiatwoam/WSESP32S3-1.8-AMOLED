[{"content":"\rOverview\rGhostESP can control a Chameleon Ultra over Bluetooth Low Energy. Once paired you can reuse the same NFC scan, save, and dump flows as if you had a PN532 module attached.\nPrerequisites\rFirmware: GhostESP build with BLE enabled and the Chameleon Ultra features compiled in. Hardware: A powered Chameleon Ultra advertising over BLE and charged enough for the session. Supported Devices\rChameleon Ultra support is available on the following GhostESP builds:\nesp32-generic.zip esp32s3-generic.zip esp32c3-generic.zip esp32c5-generic-v01.zip esp32c6-generic.zip MarauderV4_FlipperHub.zip MarauderV6_AwokDual.zip ghostboard.zip ESP32-S3-Cardputer.zip CYD2USB.zip CYDMicroUSB.zip CYDDualUSB.zip CYD2USB2.4Inch.zip CYD2USB2.4Inch_C.zip CYD2432S028R.zip LilyGo-T-Deck.zip LilyGo-TEmbedC1101.zip LilyGo-S3TWatch-2020.zip LilyGo-TDisplayS3-Touch.zip JCMK_DevBoardPro.zip RabbitLabs_Minion.zip Lolin_S3_Pro.zip CardputerADV.zip Connecting to Chameleon Ultra\rNote: GhostESP automatically suspends the access point and Wi-Fi services during the connection to free memory for BLE operations. Services restore when you disconnect.\nOn-Device UI\rOpen Main Menu → NFC → Chameleon Ultra → Connect. The device scans for nearby Chameleon Ultra devices. Wait for the connection popup to show \u0026ldquo;Connected\u0026rdquo;. Battery voltage and percentage appear below the status. Use Disconnect from the same menu when finished. Wi-Fi services resume automatically after disconnecting. Command Line\rRun chameleon connect to start pairing. Optional arguments: timeout in seconds (default 10) if you need more time for discovery. pin if your Chameleon Ultra requires a 4–6 digit security code. Example: chameleon connect 15 1234 Wait for pairing confirmation in the terminal. The CLI announces when the link succeeds. Check status with chameleon status or battery with chameleon battery. Voltage and percentage display before starting long dumps. Run chameleon disconnect when finished. BLE releases and the Wi-Fi services will restore automatically. Saving Dumps\rSave HF scans: After chameleon scanhf completes, run chameleon savehf \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; to write the dump to /mnt/ghostesp/chameleon/. Name files clearly: Use short descriptive names without spaces, for example office_door. Troubleshooting\rConnection timeouts: Keep the Chameleon Ultra awake (press any button) and re-run chameleon connect 20 for a longer window. PIN failures: Verify the configured code on the Chameleon Ultra; three failed attempts may force a power cycle. No BLE advertisements: Check the Chameleon Ultra’s BLE settings or reboot it; GhostESP only connects to active broadcasts. Next Steps\rScanning: Continue with PN532-based scanning guide. Saving: Store remote dumps using Saving Tags. Compatibility: Review what tag families work via Supported Tags.

(Optional) SD card if you plan to save tag dumps. Steps\rOpen Scan. Pick Scan in the NFC menu; the popup shows “Scanning NFC\u0026hellip;” while the PN532 spins up.\nBring in a tag. Place it flat on the antenna. The UID, ATQA, and SAK appear immediately; Classic cards flip the title to “Bruteforcing keys… 0%”.\nHold steady. Keep the tag still while reads finish. If the tag slips away, the UI pauses and prompts you to return it before resuming.\nCheck output. Review the summary, toggle More for more info, and use Save to write the dump once “NFC Tag” is displayed.\nAuto-Pause Detection\rThe scanner polls for the tag continuously. If it leaves the field mid-scan, the UI enters a paused state, disables brute-force attempts, and resumes automatically once the same UID is back in range. MIFARE Classic Flow\rDictionary attack order. GhostESP authenticates each sector using keys from /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/mfc_user_keys.nfc, then bundled common keys, then the compiled Flipper dictionary. The title bar remains on “Bruteforcing keys…” while this progresses.\nCaching behavior. Once a sector unlocks, its blocks and both Key A/Key B values are cached. The title shifts to “Reading sectors\u0026hellip;” during the copy. Successful keys are appended back to the user dictionary on the SD card.\nMagic backdoor tags. If the card supports the classic backdoor sequence, GhostESP logs the detection and can skip sector authentication, pulling data directly.\nSkip option. Tap Skip to bypass the user and dictionary lists when you only need publicly readable sectors (sector 0).\nAfter the scan. The more summary lists recovered sectors and keys as well as any detected NDEF data.\nNTAG / Ultralight Flow\rImmediate reads. NTAG21x and Ultralight tags are readable without keys, so the title stays “Scanning NFC\u0026hellip;” until the UID appears, then flips to “NFC Tag”.\nPage sweep. The reader streams all user pages, signature bytes, and counters if present. Progress is shown via the page counter in the popup body.\nNDEF parsing. Detected TLVs are decoded into text, URI, or custom payload summaries. Tap More to see the raw TLV breakdown.\nCaching and saves. All pages remain in RAM for the current session; saving writes the entire image to /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/\u0026lt;Model\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;UID\u0026gt;.nfc for later writes.\nVerification. Re-scan immediately after to confirm the data matches or to check the signature for authenticity.\nChameleon Ultra Scanning\rConnect first. Complete the Chameleon Ultra setup so GhostESP is paired over BLE. Switch to reader. Run chameleon reader in the CLI; the terminal confirms the device is ready to scan. Start HF scans. Use chameleon scanhf while holding the tag near the Chameleon Ultra antenna. The CLI mirrors the familiar popup summaries, including brute-force percentages for MIFARE Classic cards. Start LF scans. Use chameleon scanlf (or scanlfall to sweep profiles) for low-frequency tags; results appear in the CLI and the on-device terminal view. Reuse cached data. Once a scan finishes, you can proceed directly to the save flow without rescanning on the PN532. Verify\rConfirm the tag type and UID shown on-screen match the physical tag you scanned. For Mifare Classic cards, check the listed sectors to see how many keys were recovered. If you saved the capture, verify a new \u0026lt;Model\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;UID\u0026gt;.nfc file was created under /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/. Troubleshooting\rNo change from “Scanning NFC\u0026hellip;”. Re-seat the tag and verify PN532 wiring; try another tag to rule out hardware issues.\nStuck on “Bruteforcing keys… 0%”. GhostESP is testing dictionaries. Use the Skip button if you only need publicly readable blocks.\nUID reads but data is empty. The card may be write-protected or needs a key not present in your dictionaries. You can add it to your user dictionary in mnt/ghostesp/nfc/mfc_user_keys.nfc and then try rescanning.\nFAQ\rWhich keys does GhostESP try? Your User Keys list runs first, followed by bundled common keys and then the Flipper Zero Mifare Classic dictionary.\nWhat do the sector labels mean? Mifare Classic memory is split into numbered sectors, each protected by Key A and Key B. A listed sector means at least one key unlocked it during the scan.\nCan I scan other tag families? NTAG21x and Ultralight tags read without needing a brute force; they show their NDEF TLVs immediately after the UID appears.\n","description":"Read GhostESP-compatible NFC tags and understand the on-screen feedback","permalink":"/v1.8/nfc/scanning/","title":"Scanning"},{"content":"\rPrerequisites\rA PN532 or Chameleon Ultra enabled build. SD card mounted with free space. Steps\rScan a tag. Complete the process in the Scan NFC Tags guide so the popup shows detailed results. You should see the Save button enabled once data is cached.\nTap Save. Select Save in the scan popup. You should see the title change to “Saving\u0026hellip;” and the button disable while GhostESP writes the file.\nWait for confirmation. Leave the device alone until the tit reads \u0026ldquo;Saved!”. You should see the title change if the save fails (for example, “Save Failed!”).\nRepeat as needed. Saved files remain accessible even after you leave the scan popup. You should see the filename follow the pattern \u0026lt;Model\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;UID\u0026gt;.nfc in /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/.\nChameleon Ultra Saves\rUse the CLI. After finishing chameleon scanhf, stay in the terminal and run chameleon savehf \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;. Files land in /mnt/ghostesp/chameleon/. Name files clearly. Pick short descriptive filenames without spaces, for example office_door. Verify later. Saved Chameleon dumps can be copied to a PC from your SD Card exactly like PN532 captures. Verify\rBrowse the SD card and confirm the new file exists with the expected timestamp. Re-open the scan popup and use More to ensure details still match the saved dump. Optional: load the .nfc file in a Flipper Zero to confirm compatibility. Troubleshooting\rSave button disabled. Re-scan the tag and wait for the title to show “NFC Tag”. “No SD card” error. Check card seating and filesystem. The path /mnt/ghostesp/ must be writeable. File overwriting unexpectedly. GhostESP auto-generates names and will overwrite if the same model/UID combination is scanned repeatedly. FAQ\rCan I save after removing the tag? Yes. Once the scan completes, the device keeps data in RAM, allowing offline saves. What if the tag is MIFARE Classic? GhostESP saves all recovered sectors and keys, so you can reopen the file later without re-running the dictionary attack. Where are the files stored? Under /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/. ","description":"Store scanned NFC tags as Flipper-compatible files","permalink":"/v1.8/nfc/saving/","title":"Saving Tags"},{"content":"\rPrerequisites\rAn NTAG .nfc file on the SD card under /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/ created from a previous scan or copied manually. NTAG21x or Ultralight tag compatible with the captured image size (NTAG213/215/216 page counts). A PN532 or Chameleon Ultra enabled build with a connected PN532 module or Chameleon Ultra. Steps\rOpen NFC → Write. From the NFC menu, choose Write. You should see a list of .nfc files detected on the SD card.\nSelect an image. Tap the file you want to program. You should see a popup summarizing the tag model, UID (if present), and total pages.\nStart the write. Choose Write in the popup. You should see the status change to “Present tag to write\u0026hellip;” while GhostESP waits for a blank card.\nPresent the blank tag. Hold the target NTAG on the antenna until the title updates. You should see “Writing… X%” as each page is written, finishing at “Write complete”.\nChameleon Ultra Writing\rNo remote writes. GhostESP cannot program tags through the Chameleon Ultra; use the PN532 workflow above. Verify\rRe-scan the card using the Scan NFC Tags guide to confirm the UID (if applicable) and data match the source image. Check the popup for success messages; any failed page write will trigger an error log with the page number. Optional: load the card in an external reader to confirm the NDEF payload or application data. Troubleshooting\rFile list empty. Ensure .nfc files exist under /mnt/ghostesp/nfc/ and the SD card is mounted.\n“Present tag to write\u0026hellip;” never changes. The PN532 cannot see the card. Re-seat the antenna or try a different blank tag.\nWrite stops mid-way. Remove the tag, power-cycle GhostESP, and retry. Persistent failures often mean the card’s capacity does not match the image (e.g., writing a 216-page dump to a 213 card).\nFAQ\rCan I clone MIFARE Classic with this flow? No, the Write flow is limited to NTAG/Ultralight dumps today. Do I need to keep holding the card after 100%? Hold it until “Write complete” appears; the device finalizes status after the last page. Will the UID be overwritten? NTAG UIDs are read-only. The saved UID is used for naming and verification, but the physical card keeps its factory UID.
