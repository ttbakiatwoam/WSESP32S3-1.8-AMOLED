[{"content":"The build.py helper wraps Espressif\u0026rsquo;s build tools so you can change GhostESP feature flags without setting up the environment manually. Follow the steps below to run menuconfig, persist your changes, and rebuild with the updated settings.\nPrerequisites\rPython 3 installed with access to the command line. ESP-IDF v5.4.1, v5.5 or v5.5.1 on disk. build.py can auto-detect common locations or also download it for you. GhostESP repository cloned locally. Clone from GitHub and navigate into the project directory before running the script. 1. Launch the helper\rFrom the project root, run:\npython build.py If you already know which boards you want to modify, you can skip the interactive picker:\npython build.py --targets 2 3 Use --targets all to queue every board profile.\nWhen prompted for ESP-IDF, confirm a detected path or allow the script to download v5.5 automatically. Supplying --idf-path \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; bypasses the prompt entirely.\n2. Select a build target\rGhostESP ships configs for multiple boards inside configs/. The helper lists them with numeric IDs. Enter the index for the target whose Kconfig you want to edit (for example esp32s3-generic).\nThe script copies that entry\u0026rsquo;s sdkconfig.* file into sdkconfig and sdkconfig.defaults, then runs idf.py set-target so menuconfig matches the board.\n3. Run menuconfig for GhostESP options\rAfter applying the base config, build.py launches:\nidf.py menuconfig Use the curses UI to browse GhostESP Options → GhostESP Features and any other menus you need. When finished, save and exit menuconfig.\nEnabling NFC features\rOpen Ghost ESP Options → NFC Options to toggle the backends:\nEnable PN532 NFC turns on the PN532 reader and exposes pin settings for SCL/SDA/IRQ/RST. Enable Chameleon Ultra NFC lets GhostESP use a Chameleon Ultra over BLE as the NFC front-end. This option defaults to enabled when BLE is compiled in. Turning on either backend automatically sets the internal HAS_NFC flag, which enables the UI and shared NFC code paths.\nEnabling displays\rNavigate to Ghost ESP Options → Display Options for screen hardware:\nToggle Enable Screen Support to bring the LCD driver into the build. Adjust resolution via TFT Width and TFT Height, or enable board-specific panels such as Enable Waveshare LCD, Enable Crowtech LCD, Enable Sunton LCD, or Enable JC3248W535EN LCD depending on your hardware. Optional helpers like Enable Touchscreen, Use 7-inch Display, and Enable Status Display expose extra pins and I2C settings when needed. Configuring LVGL display driver\rAfter enabling Enable Screen Support, navigate to Component config → LVGL to configure the display driver:\nUnder LVGL TFT Display, select your display controller (e.g., ILI9341, ST7789, etc.). Configure LVGL Touch Input if your screen has a touchscreen. Adjust LVGL Display Settings for rotation, color depth, and refresh rate as needed for your hardware. 4. Decide where to store your changes\rOnce menuconfig exits, build.py asks whether to write the new configuration back into the source tree:\nYes — Copies the generated sdkconfig into the original configs/sdkconfig.* file and into sdkconfig.defaults. Choose this when you want the board profile to permanently carry the new settings. No — Keeps sdkconfig.defaults updated for the current build only without altering the source file. This is useful when experimenting. Regardless of your choice, the helper syncs sdkconfig.defaults so the next build uses the options you just saved.\n5. Rebuild firmware (optional)\rIf you continue through the prompts, build.py can clean, rebuild, and package artifacts automatically. Otherwise, rerun later with:\npython build.py --targets \u0026lt;index\u0026gt; The script will reuse the modified sdkconfig.defaults unless you overwrite it.\nTips\rRunning python build.py --no-auto-download disables the ESP-IDF fetch prompt if you prefer manual installs only. Delete sdkconfig and sdkconfig.defaults to revert to the pristine profile before another run. Use separate directories or virtual environments per ESP-IDF version to avoid mixing toolchains when switching targets.
