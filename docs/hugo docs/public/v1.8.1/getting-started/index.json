This allows one device to host the access point continuously while the other performs attacks or scans, all controllable from the web interface.\nPrerequisites\rTwo compatible ESP32 boards. Three wires (TX, RX, GND) to connect them. Both devices flashed with GhostESP firmware. How it works\rWire two ESP32s together via UART. They auto-discover and connect on boot. Send any GhostESP command from one device to the other. No manual connection commands needed in most cases. Wiring\rConnect the devices with 3 wires:\nTX of Device A → RX of Device B (GPIO 6 → GPIO 7 by default, 17 → 16 on base ESP32 models) RX of Device A → TX of Device B (GPIO 7 → GPIO 6 by default, 16 → 17 on base ESP32 models) GND → GND Both devices need power.\nBasic usage\rOnce wired and powered on, devices automatically find each other:\ncommstatus - Check if connected commsend \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; - Send any command to the other device commdisconnect - Disconnect if needed Examples\rcommstatus - Check connection commsend scanap - Send command to other device commsend attack -d - Start attack on other device commsend beaconspam -r - Start beacon spam on other device commsend capture -probe - Start probe capture on other device Changing pins\rDefault pins are TX: GPIO 6, RX: GPIO 7 (or 17 and 16 on base ESP32 models). To change them:\nRun commsetpins \u0026lt;TX_PIN\u0026gt; \u0026lt;RX_PIN\u0026gt; (for example, commsetpins 4 5).\nPin changes are saved and persist across reboots. You cannot change pins while connected.\nManual connection\rIf auto-connection fails, you can manually connect:\ncommdiscovery - Check discovery status commconnect ESP_A1B2C3 - Connect to specific device Device names are auto-generated based on MAC address (format: ESP_XXXXXX).\nTroubleshooting\rNot connecting: Check wiring (TX→RX, RX→TX, GND connected). Make sure both devices are powered. Reboot them simultaneously and wait 30 seconds for discovery. Run commstatus to check. Commands not working: Verify connection with commstatus. Use exact GhostESP command syntax. Use cases\rHidden device control: Hide one ESP32 and control it remotely with full functionality through the web interface. Coordinated attacks: Both devices attack different targets simultaneously. Continuous AP hosting: One device maintains the access point while the other performs intensive operations. Notes\rAuto-discovery happens every 3 seconds. Connection uses UART at 115,200 baud. The device with the \u0026ldquo;larger\u0026rdquo; name becomes master, but commands can be sent from both directions. Auto-reconnect is enabled; the connection will automatically restore if interrupted. Physical wired connection is required.

These commands require the device\u0026rsquo;s radio hardware, which conflicts with hosting the Wi-Fi access point.\nTo run Wi-Fi or BLE commands from the WebUI:\nSet up Dual Communication with two ESP32 devices wired together. One device hosts the access point (runs WebUI). The other device performs attacks/scans. Send commands through the WebUI using commsend \u0026lt;command\u0026gt;. Example workflow:\nDevice A (with WebUI): Hosts GhostNet AP Device B (attack device): Wired to Device A via UART From WebUI on Device A: commsend scanap → scans on Device B From WebUI on Device A: commsend karma start → runs Karma on Device B Commands that work directly in WebUI:\rNFC commands (scanning, writing, saving) Infrared commands (learning, transmitting) File management Device configuration Help and diagnostics Tips and Tricks\rFaster File Transfers\rUse a card reader connected to your computer instead of the WebUI for faster PCAP and file transfers. The WebUI file manager is convenient but slower over Wi-Fi. Toggle Authentication When Needed\rwebauth on — enable HTTP Digest authentication for the WebUI. webauth off — return to the default open-access mode. Troubleshooting\rCan\u0026rsquo;t connect to GhostNet\rGhostNet not visible: Reboot the device. It should broadcast the AP within 10 seconds of boot. Connection drops: Move closer to the device or check for interference. Wrong password: Default is GhostNet (case-sensitive). Can\u0026rsquo;t reach the WebUI\rPage won\u0026rsquo;t load: Try 192.168.4.1 instead of ghostesp.local. \u0026ldquo;Connection refused\u0026rdquo;: The device may still be booting. Wait 10 seconds and refresh. Timeout: Check that you\u0026rsquo;re connected to the GhostNet AP, not a different network. Login fails\rAuthentication prompts unexpectedly: Run webauth off to confirm the feature is disabled. Credentials rejected: If you enabled auth, defaults are GhostNet / GhostNet (case-sensitive). Forgot credentials: Reboot the device to reset to defaults. Wi-Fi commands don\u0026rsquo;t work\r\u0026ldquo;Command not available\u0026rdquo;: You need dual communication. See Dual Communication for setup. Command times out: Verify the second device is wired correctly and powered on. File manager is slow\rDownloads are slow: Use a USB card reader instead.

What are the default network credentials?\rSSID: GhostNet Password: GhostNet 2. What are the default credentials for the web interface?\rAuthentication is off by default in v1.8.1. If you enable it with webauth on, the defaults are: Username: GhostNet Password: GhostNet 3. How do I access the web interface?\rConnect to the GhostNet WiFi network. Open your browser and visit: ghostesp.local or 192.168.4.1 4. Why don’t the default credentials work for the web interface?\rThe web interface uses the same credentials as your WiFi AP. If you’ve changed your WiFi SSID or password, your web interface credentials also change. To disable authentication, open the GhostESP terminal or a serial console and run webauth off, then restart the device. Note\nThe firmware has a subtle password-length mismatch: the AP code falls back to the default password unless the saved password is longer than 8 characters, while web authentication treats passwords of length 8 as valid. If you set an exactly 8-character password you may see the web UI and AP use different credentials; use a password longer than 8 characters to avoid this.\n5. How do I flash my board?\rSee the Installation Guide. Use the web flasher at: https://flasher.ghostesp.net/ 6. Can I upload custom Evil Portal HTML over Serial or from my Flipper Zero?\rSD Card: Place custom HTML in /ghostesp/evil_portal/portals on your SD card. Flipper Zero App: You can upload simple HTML (max 2048 bytes) directly via the app (v1.4+ and firmware v1.7+). 7. My board isn’t currently supported. Will you add support?\rUnless something is said otherwise, no. Feel free to do it yourself—we accept and appreciate PRs. 8. Why does my connection to the GhostESP AP drop when issuing WiFi commands?\rThe ESP32 can’t operate as both an Access Point and WiFi Client at the same time. Switching modes will disconnect your device from the AP. 9. I’m not seeing any output when connecting via Serial.\rThe firmware is silent unless a command is running. Try sending the help command to verify your connection or reconnecting; sometimes you will have a bad connection. 10. Why won’t my SD card work?\r\u0026ldquo;Generic\u0026rdquo; firmware builds include SD card support by default; use sd_config to see the pins or sd_pins_spi \u0026lt;cs\u0026gt; \u0026lt;clk\u0026gt; \u0026lt;miso\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mosi\u0026gt; to set SPI pins and sd_save_config to save the pin config to SD card.
