[{"content":"Wi-Fi attacks sound complex, but they\u0026rsquo;re built on a few simple ideas. This page explains what each attack does, why someone might use it, and what you need to know before trying the tools in GhostESP.\nWhat is a Wi-Fi attack?\rA Wi-Fi attack is any action that disrupts, intercepts, or tricks Wi-Fi networks or devices. Most attacks fall into two categories:\nPassive: You listen and record without sending anything. Example: capturing packets to see what devices are on a network. Active: You send frames or signals to change how the network behaves. Example: sending deauth frames to kick devices off. Common attacks explained\rPacket Capture\rWhat it does: Records all Wi-Fi traffic on a channel and saves it to a file (PCAP format).\nWhy: You can analyze the data later to see what devices are connecting, what SSIDs they\u0026rsquo;re looking for, or extract handshakes for password testing.\nLegal note: Capturing traffic on networks you don\u0026rsquo;t own is illegal in most places. Only do this on your own network or with explicit permission.\nLearn more: Capturing packets\nDeauthentication (Deauth)\rWhat it does: Sends a fake \u0026ldquo;disconnect\u0026rdquo; message to a device, forcing it off the network.\nWhy: Tests network stability, forces devices to reconnect (so you can capture their handshake), or disrupts a specific device.\nLegal note: Deauthing devices you don\u0026rsquo;t own is illegal. Only test on your own network.\nKarma Attack\rWhat it does: Pretends to be a Wi-Fi network that a device is looking for, tricking the device into connecting.\nWhy: Intercept traffic from devices, test how devices behave when connecting to fake networks, or study device behavior.\nLegal note: Tricking devices into connecting without consent is illegal in most jurisdictions.\nLearn more: Karma attacks\nEvil Portal\rWhat it does: Creates a fake Wi-Fi network with a login page that looks real (like a coffee shop Wi-Fi).\nWhy: Capture credentials, redirect users to a phishing site, or test how users respond to fake login pages.\nLegal note: Impersonating a real network or capturing credentials without consent is illegal.\nLearn more: Evil portals\nHandshake Capture\rWhat it does: Records the WPA/WPA2 authentication handshake between a device and router.\nWhy: Export the handshake to offline password cracking tools to test weak passwords.\nLegal note: Cracking passwords on networks you don\u0026rsquo;t own is illegal.\nLearn more: Handshakes\nBefore you start\rPrerequisites\rA GhostESP device (flashed and working) An SD card (for saving captures) A network you own or have permission to test Basic understanding of Wi-Fi (SSIDs, channels, 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz) Legal and ethical rules\rOnly test networks you own or have written permission to test. Unauthorized access to networks or devices is illegal in most countries. Disrupting networks (deauth, jamming) without permission is illegal. Impersonating networks or capturing credentials is illegal. Check your local laws before testing. Typical workflow\rScan the area to find networks and devices (see Survey). Choose an attack based on what you want to learn (see attack descriptions above). Capture or execute using the GhostESP menu or CLI. Analyze the results on your computer (e.g., open PCAP files in Wireshark).

You can scan passively without connecting, or connect to a network and explore devices on it.\nPrerequisites\rGhostESP flashed device, powered on with a wireless antenna. Finding nearby networks\rOn-device UI\rOpen Menu → WiFi → Scanning. You should see a menu with scan options. Choose Scan Access Points. The device will search for networks. Wait for the scan to finish and see a summary. Select List Access Points. You should see each network listed with its name, channel, signal strength, and device manufacturer. On-device UI — Optional features\rScan APs Live: Watch new networks appear in real time as they\u0026rsquo;re discovered. Channel Congestion: See how busy the wireless channels are in your area. Command line\rOpen the GhostESP terminal (serial connection or on-device terminal). Run scanap to start a scan. Wait for it to finish and show results. Run list -a to see the cached list of networks. Command line — Optional features\rRun scanap -live to watch networks appear as they\u0026rsquo;re discovered. Exploring a network\rOnce you connect to a network, you can discover devices and services on it.\nConnect to a network\rOpen Menu → WiFi → Connection → Connect to WiFi. Enter the network name and password when prompted. Wait for the connection to complete. The terminal will show status updates. To disconnect later, go to Menu → WiFi → Connection → Disconnect. Connect via command line\rRun connect \u0026quot;SSID\u0026quot; \u0026quot;password\u0026quot; (use quotes if the name or password has spaces). The terminal will show connection progress and confirm when connected. Run connect with no arguments to reconnect to the last network you used. Run disconnect to leave the network. Find devices on the network\rOpen Menu → WiFi → Scanning while connected. Choose Scan LAN Devices. You should see a list of devices and services on the network. Find devices via command line\rRun scanlocal to discover devices and services. You should see hostnames, service types, and ports. Run scanarp to find all active devices on the network. You should see IP addresses and device information. Check for open ports\rFrom the UI, select a device with Select LAN, then choose Scan Open Ports. You should see which ports are responding on that device. From the command line, run scanports \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; to check a specific device. You should see open ports listed. Add all to check all ports, or start-end (like 20-1024) for a range. Run scanssh \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; to specifically check if a device has SSH enabled. Troubleshooting\rNo networks found: Move closer to wireless routers and try scanning again. \u0026ldquo;You Need to Scan APs First\u0026rdquo; message: Run a scan before trying to select a network. Live scan stops right away: Stop any active Wi-Fi attacks or portals from the menu and try again. FAQ\rCan I scan while connected to a network? Yes. The device will pause the connection briefly to scan, then resume. Where do the device vendor names come from? GhostESP looks up the device\u0026rsquo;s hardware address in a small built-in database to potentially identify the manufacturer.

You can then review the captured data on your computer or Flipper Zero.\nPrerequisites\rGhostESP flashed device with an SD card mounted. Optional: Flipper Zero with a microSD card if you want to save captures to the flipper. Capturing traffic\rOn-device UI\rOpen Menu → WiFi → Capture. You should see a list of capture types to choose from. Select the type of traffic you want to record (see capture types below). The device will start recording. Leave it running until you have enough data. Back out of the terminal view to stop recording. The device will save the file to the SD card and show the file path. Retrieve the file from the SD card using the GhostNet WebUI file browser or by removing the card. Files are saved under /mnt/ghostesp/pcaps/ with names like probescan_3.pcap. Command line\rOpen the GhostESP terminal. Run capture -\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; where type is one of the capture types below (for example, capture -probe). The device will start recording. Let it run while traffic is collected. Run capture -stop when you\u0026rsquo;re done. The device will save the file and show where it was saved. Capture modes\r-probe: Records probe requests so you can see devices searching for known SSIDs. -deauth: Records deauthentication frames to diagnose disconnect storms or targeted kicks. -beacon: Records beacons to review advertised SSIDs and channel metadata. -raw: Dumps every Wi-Fi frame seen on the tuned channel for full analysis. -eapol: Captures WPA/WPA2 4-way handshakes, PMKID messages, and rekeys so you can validate client authentications or export the flow for offline key cracking. -pwn: Records frames from Pwnagotchi devices. -wps: Captures Wi-Fi Protected Setup traffic to confirm whether a router exposes WPS enrolment. -802154 (ESP32-C5/C6 only): Records IEEE 802.15.4 frames when you supply capture -802154. Verify\rConfirm the SD card contains a .pcap file. Open the file in Wireshark app to make sure packets are listed. Notes\rCaptures save to /mnt/ghostesp/pcaps/ only when an SD card is mounted. If the folder is missing the device streams packets over UART to the Flipper Zero when writing a file. The firmware logs PCAP: saving to SD as ... when file storage is active, or PCAP: streaming over UART when it falls back to the terminal. Flipper Zero GhostESP app expects captures under /ext/apps_data/ghost_esp/pcaps/ on its microSD. Copy the .pcap using QFlipper or Straight from the Flipper\u0026rsquo;s SD Card to review it in Wireshark or et cetera. Large captures can take time to copy. Use a card reader instead of QFlipper or the WebUI for faster transfers. Troubleshooting\rCapture file not saved: Make sure the SD card is mounted and has free space. Always use stop or back out through the menu to properly save the file. SD card not recognized: Reboot the device with the SD card already inserted. Check that the card is properly seated and not corrupted. File transfer is slow: Use a card reader connected to your computer instead of the WebUI or other methods for faster transfers.
