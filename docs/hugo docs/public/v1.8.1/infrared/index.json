[{"content":"\rBefore you start\rHardware: Use a board with IR RX support (see hardware requirements). SD card: Inserted and mounted so GhostESP can save .ir files under /ghostesp/infrared/. Easy Learn: Optional assistant that suggests button names; toggle it via infrared_easy in the command line config or the settings menu. Learn a remote or button\rOpen the Infrared view from the main menu and choose Learn Remote for a new file or Learn Button inside a saved remote to append a new signal to an existing remote.\nAlign the source remote with the IR receiver window, hold it steady within a few centimeters, then press the button once.\nConfirm the button name. Easy Learn provides a suggested label during learning, otherwise use the on-screen keyboard.\nWatch the preview popup for carrier frequency, protocol name, and decoded address/command details. Cancel and retry if you recieve a raw decode on a known non-raw signal.\nConfirm to save. GhostESP will create a new .ir file for fresh remotes or append the button to the currently open file automatically.\nStorage layout\rNew remotes are written to /ghostesp/infrared/remotes/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.ir. Adding to an existing remote appends another named button block inside the same .ir file. Tips\rKeep the remote within a few centimeters of the receiver and avoid direct sunlight. If learning fails, exit and re-open the Infrared learning popup to try to reinitialize the RMT RX channel.

Pick a Flipper-compatible .ir file. GhostESP parses the sections inside the file and lists every named button. Tap a button entry to transmit. The configured LED should flash pink if not in stealth mode. Tip: If you see “No .ir files” in the Remotes or Universals lists, try reinserting your SD card and rebooting the device. Ensure the /ghostesp/infrared/remotes and /ghostesp/infrared/universals folders exist on the card.\nUniversal libraries\rUniversal .ir packs live under /ghostesp/infrared/universals and contain large collections of commands grouped by device. When you open a universal file, GhostESP scans the command list and prompts you to pick a specific button to send. Parsing very large libraries (for example, community dumps) can take several seconds; wait for the list to finish populating before selecting. You can find supported universals at Momentum Flipper Firmware. Download and place the files under infrared/universals. Universal IR Database\rGhostESP also includes a built-in Universal IR file with popular TV POWER signals. Use the TURNHISTVOFF universal to turn on or off many different TVs.\nTips\rAim the device’s IR LED directly at the target device’s receiver window and stay within a few meters. If nothing happens, close the popup, verify you chose the right protocol (raw vs decoded), and relearn the button or test another signal. Ensure no bright sunlight hits the receiver; ambient infrared noise can reduce range. ","description":"Send captured or universal IR commands","permalink":"/v1.8.1/infrared/transmitting/","title":"Transmitting Signals"},{"content":"\rDirectory layout\r/ghostesp/infrared/remotes holds individual remotes captured on-device. /ghostesp/infrared/universals stores library files with many commands. The Infrared UI reads from /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/... when the SD card is mounted. Flipper IR libraries\rGhostESP reads the standard Flipper .ir format, so you can copy files from community packs. A large collection is available at Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB; place downloaded files under infrared/remote or infrared/universals for universal files which you can find in Momentum custom Flipper Zero firmware. Built-in Universal IR file\rIn addition to SD card files, GhostESP includes a built-in Universal IR file with popular TV POWER signals. This file doesn\u0026rsquo;t require an SD card.\nAppend new signals\rChoose Add Signal while a remote is open to append a newly learned button. Easy Learn suggests button names; otherwise you will be prompted via the on-screen keyboard. Web UI management\rConnect to the GhostNet AP and open the web UI. Browse to the file manager tab and navigate to /ghostesp/infrared/. Upload .ir files to the appropriate folder or download existing ones for backups. Tips\rKeep file names short; the UI truncates long names in lists. After mass uploads, back out of the infrared file view on the on-board display UI to refresh the list. Back up your IR folder before flashing new firmware or reformatting the SD card.
