[{"content":"\rBefore you start\rHardware: Board with IR RX support (see hardware requirements). SD card: Inserted and mounted so GhostESP can save .ir files under /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/. Easy Learn: Optional assistant that suggests button names. Toggle via settings. Learn a remote or button\rOpen Infrared and choose Learn Remote or Learn Button to append to an existing remote.\nAlign the source remote with the IR receiver window, hold it steady within a few centimeters, then press the button once.\nConfirm the button name. Easy Learn provides a suggested label during learning, otherwise use the on-screen keyboard.\nWatch the preview popup for carrier frequency, protocol name, and decoded address/command details. Cancel and retry if you recieve a raw decode on a known non-raw signal.\nConfirm to save. GhostESP will create a new .ir file for fresh remotes or append the button to the currently open file automatically.\nStorage layout\rNew remotes are written to /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/remotes/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.ir. Adding to an existing remote appends another named button block inside the same .ir file. Tips\rKeep the remote within a few centimeters of the receiver and avoid direct sunlight. If learning fails, exit and re-open the Infrared learning popup to try to reinitialize the RMT RX channel. CLI Support\rYou can learn signals via the command line using ir learn.\n# Learn a signal and auto-save to a new file under /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/remotes ir learn # Learn and append to a specific file ir learn /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/remotes/my_remote.ir Without a path, GhostESP generates a new .ir file name based on the decoded protocol/address/command (or a RAW timestamp) in /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/remotes/. With a path, the learned signal is appended to the given .ir file. Manual File Creation\rYou can manually create .ir files if you know the protocol details. Save them as text files with the .ir extension in /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/remotes/.\nExample .ir file content:\nFiletype: IR signals file Version: 1 name: Power type: parsed protocol: NEC address: 00 FF command: 00 FF ","description":"Capture IR buttons and remotes with GhostESP","permalink":"/latest/infrared/learning/","title":"Learning Signals"},{"content":"\rSend a saved command\rOpen Infrared and browse Remotes to see saved .ir files. Pick a Flipper-compatible .ir file. GhostESP parses the sections inside the file and lists every named button. Tap a button entry to transmit. The configured LED should flash pink if not in stealth mode. Tip: If you see “No .ir files” in the Remotes or Universals lists, try reinserting your SD card and rebooting the device. Ensure the /ghostesp/infrared/remotes and /ghostesp/infrared/universals folders exist on the card.\nUniversal libraries\rUniversal .ir packs live under /ghostesp/infrared/universals and contain large collections of commands grouped by device. When you open a universal file, GhostESP scans the command list and prompts you to pick a specific button to send. Parsing very large libraries (for example, community dumps) can take several seconds; wait for the list to finish populating before selecting. You can find supported universals at Momentum Flipper Firmware. Download and place the files under infrared/universals. GhostESP also includes a built-in Universal IR file with popular TV POWER signals. Use the TURNHISTVOFF universal to turn on or off many different TVs.\nTips\rAim the LED directly at the target\u0026rsquo;s receiver window. If nothing happens, close the popup, verify you chose the right protocol (raw vs decoded), and relearn the button or test another signal. Ensure no bright sunlight hits the receiver; ambient infrared noise can reduce range. CLI Support\rYou can transmit signals using the command line interface, which is useful for scripting or automation.\nSending from file\rUse ir send to transmit a signal from an existing .ir file:\n# Send the first signal in the file\rir send /ghostesp/infrared/remotes/TV.ir\r# Send the 3rd signal (index 2)\rir send /ghostesp/infrared/remotes/TV.ir 2 Inline Sending\rYou can send raw or parsed signals directly without a file using the inline mode markers. This is useful for sending commands from a script or external tool.\nText Format:\n[IR/BEGIN] name: Power type: parsed protocol: NEC address: FF 00 command: E7 18 [IR/CLOSE] JSON Format:\n[IR/BEGIN] {\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;parsed\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;protocol\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;NEC\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;address\u0026#34;:65280,\u0026#34;command\u0026#34;:59160} [IR/CLOSE] See the CLI Reference for full command details.\n","description":"Send captured or universal IR commands","permalink":"/latest/infrared/transmitting/","title":"Transmitting Signals"},{"content":"\rOverview\rIR Dazzler emits continuous IR at 38 kHz to overwhelm night-vision cameras.

Look for infrared support listed in the release notes or above before flashing.\nWiring and Developer notes\rIR LED: Connected to CONFIG_INFRARED_LED_PIN. Use a current-limiting resistor if adding an external LED. IR Receiver: Required for learning. Boards with CONFIG_HAS_INFRARED_RX set expose the pin via CONFIG_INFRARED_RX_PIN. Power and positioning\rKeep the LED unobstructed and aimed at the target device. For learning, place the source remote close to the receiver window and shield it from direct sunlight or fluorescent flicker.
