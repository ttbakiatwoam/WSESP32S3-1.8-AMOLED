[{"content":"Wi-Fi attacks sound complex, but they\u0026rsquo;re built on a few simple ideas. This page explains what each attack does, why someone might use it, and what you need to know before trying the tools in GhostESP.\nWhat is a Wi-Fi attack?\rA Wi-Fi attack is any action that disrupts, intercepts, or tricks Wi-Fi networks or devices. Most attacks fall into two categories:\nPassive: You listen and record without sending anything. Example: capturing packets to see what devices are on a network. Active: You send frames or signals to change how the network behaves. Example: sending deauth frames to kick devices off. Common attacks explained\rPacket Capture\rWhat it does: Records all Wi-Fi traffic on a channel and saves it to a file (PCAP format).\nWhy: You can analyze the data later to see what devices are connecting, what SSIDs they\u0026rsquo;re looking for, or extract handshakes for password testing.\nLegal note: Capturing traffic on networks you don\u0026rsquo;t own is illegal in most places. Only do this on your own network or with explicit permission.\nLearn more: Capturing packets\nDeauthentication (Deauth)\rWhat it does: Sends a fake \u0026ldquo;disconnect\u0026rdquo; message to a device, forcing it off the network.\nWhy: Tests network stability, forces devices to reconnect (so you can capture their handshake), or disrupts a specific device.\nLegal note: Deauthing devices you don\u0026rsquo;t own is illegal. Only test on your own network.\nLearn more: Deauthentication attacks\nKarma Attack\rWhat it does: Pretends to be a Wi-Fi network that a device is looking for, tricking the device into connecting.\nWhy: Intercept traffic from devices or test how they behave when connecting to fake networks.\nLegal note: Tricking devices into connecting without consent is illegal in most jurisdictions.\nLearn more: Karma attacks\nEvil Portal\rWhat it does: Creates a fake Wi-Fi network with a login page that looks real (like a coffee shop Wi-Fi).\nWhy: Capture credentials, redirect users to a phishing site, or test how users respond to fake login pages.\nLegal note: Impersonating a real network or capturing credentials without consent is illegal.\nLearn more: Evil portals\nHandshake Capture\rWhat it does: Records the WPA/WPA2 authentication handshake between a device and router.\nWhy: Export the handshake to offline password cracking tools to test weak passwords.\nLegal note: Cracking passwords on networks you don\u0026rsquo;t own is illegal.\nLearn more: Handshakes\nBefore you start\rPrerequisites\rA GhostESP device (flashed and working) An SD card (for saving captures) A network you own or have permission to test Basic understanding of Wi-Fi (SSIDs, channels, 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz) Legal and ethical rules\rOnly test networks you own or have written permission to test. Unauthorized access to networks or devices is illegal in most countries. Disrupting networks (deauth, jamming) without permission is illegal. Impersonating networks or capturing credentials is illegal. Check your local laws before testing. Typical workflow\rScan the area to find networks and devices (see Survey). Choose an attack based on what you want to learn (see attack descriptions above). Capture or execute using the GhostESP menu or CLI. Analyze the results on your computer (e.g., open PCAP files in Wireshark).

You can then review the captured data on your computer or Flipper Zero.\nPrerequisites\rGhostESP flashed device with an SD card mounted. Optional: Flipper Zero with a microSD card if you want to save captures to the flipper. Capturing traffic\rOn-device UI\rOpen Menu → WiFi → Capture. You should see a list of capture types to choose from. Select the type of traffic you want to record (see capture types below). The device will start recording. Leave it running until you have enough data. Back out of the terminal view to stop recording. The device will save the file to the SD card and show the file path. Retrieve the file from the SD card using the GhostNet WebUI file browser or by removing the card. Files are saved under /mnt/ghostesp/pcaps/ with names like probescan_3.pcap. Command line\rOpen the GhostESP terminal. Run capture -\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; where type is one of the capture types below (for example, capture -probe). The device will start recording. Let it run while traffic is collected. Run capture -stop when you\u0026rsquo;re done. The device will save the file and show where it was saved. Capture modes\r-probe: Records probe requests so you can see devices searching for known SSIDs. -deauth: Records deauthentication frames to diagnose disconnect storms or targeted kicks. -beacon: Records beacons to review advertised SSIDs and channel metadata. -raw: Dumps every Wi-Fi frame seen on the tuned channel for full analysis. -eapol: Captures WPA/WPA2 4-way handshakes, PMKID messages, and rekeys so you can validate client authentications or export the flow for offline key cracking. -pwn: Records frames from Pwnagotchi devices. -wps: Captures Wi-Fi Protected Setup traffic to confirm whether a router exposes WPS enrolment. -802154 (ESP32-C5/C6 only): Records IEEE 802.15.4 frames when you supply capture -802154. Verify\rConfirm the SD card contains a .pcap file. Open the file in Wireshark app to make sure packets are listed. Notes\rCaptures save to /mnt/ghostesp/pcaps/ only when an SD card is mounted. If the folder is missing the device streams packets over UART to the Flipper Zero when writing a file. The firmware logs PCAP: saving to SD as ... when file storage is active, or PCAP: streaming over UART when it falls back to the terminal. Flipper Zero GhostESP app expects captures under /ext/apps_data/ghost_esp/pcaps/ on its microSD. Copy the .pcap using QFlipper or directly from the Flipper\u0026rsquo;s SD card to review in Wireshark. Large captures can take time to copy. Use a card reader instead of QFlipper or the WebUI for faster transfers. Troubleshooting\rCapture file not saved: Make sure the SD card is mounted and has free space. Always use stop or back out through the menu to properly save the file. SD card not recognized: Reboot the device with the SD card already inserted. Check that the card is properly seated and not corrupted. File transfer is slow: Use a card reader connected to your computer instead of the WebUI or other methods for faster transfers.

This is useful for testing network resilience or capturing authentication handshakes when devices reconnect.\nNote: Only perform deauth attacks on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Disrupting networks without authorization is illegal.\nHow it works\rWi-Fi networks use management frames to coordinate connections. Two of these frames can terminate a connection:\nDeauthentication frame: Ends the authentication relationship Disassociation frame: Ends the association relationship GhostESP sends both frame types. Since these frames are part of the original Wi-Fi standard (802.11), most devices have no way to verify if the message is legitimate.\nBroadcast and targeted attacks\rThe attack sends frames in two ways:\nBroadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF): Hits all devices on the network without needing to know who\u0026rsquo;s connected Targeted: If you\u0026rsquo;ve scanned for stations (scansta), GhostESP automatically includes any discovered clients associated with the selected AP Bidirectional frames\rFor targeted stations, GhostESP sends frames in both directions:\nAP → Station: Appears to come from the access point, telling the device to disconnect Station → AP: Appears to come from the device, telling the AP the device is leaving This makes the attack more reliable since both sides think the connection ended.\nFrequency band limitations\r2.4 GHz only (most boards)\rMost ESP32 boards (ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6) only support 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi. This means:\nYou can only deauth networks on channels 1–14 5 GHz networks are invisible and unaffected Many modern routers use both bands—devices on the 5 GHz band will stay connected 5 GHz support (ESP32-C5)\rThe ESP32-C5 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, allowing you to:\nScan and attack networks on all Wi-Fi channels Target devices on 5 GHz networks If your target network uses 5 GHz, you need an ESP32-C5 based device.\nProtected Management Frames (PMF)\rPMF (also called MFP or 802.11w) is a security feature that cryptographically signs management frames. When enabled, devices can verify that deauth frames actually came from the real access point.\nNetworks immune to deauth\rWPA3 networks: PMF is mandatory. Deauth attacks will not work. WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode: Devices using WPA3 are protected; WPA2 devices may still be vulnerable. WPA2 with PMF enabled: Some enterprise networks enable PMF on WPA2. How to check\rWhen you scan networks on an ESP32-C5 or ESP32-C6, GhostESP shows the security type and PMF status:\nSSID: MyNetwork\rBand: 2.4GHz\rSecurity: WPA3\rPMF: Required If you see PMF: Required, deauth attacks will have no effect on that network.\nPrerequisites\rGhostESP device Target network on a supported frequency band (2.4 GHz for most boards, or 5 GHz with ESP32-C5) Country code set in device settings (see Troubleshooting if you get errors) Launching a deauth attack\rOn-device UI\rOpen Menu → WiFi → Scanning and wait for the scan to complete. Select your target with Select AP. Open Menu → WiFi → Attacks → Deauth. The device will continuously send deauth frames to all clients on that network. To stop, navigate to Menu → WiFi → Attacks → Stop Attack or run stopdeauth. Command line\rScan for networks: scanap List results: list -a Select your target (replace 1 with the network number): select -a 1 Start the attack: attack -d Stop the attack: stopdeauth Targeting multiple networks\rYou can select multiple access points at once:\nselect -a 1,3,5\rattack -d GhostESP groups APs by channel to minimize channel-switching overhead. APs on the same channel are attacked together before moving to the next channel.\nTroubleshooting\rESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG when deauthing\rThis error occurs when attempting to deauth a network on a channel not allowed by your current country code setting. By default, GhostESP uses \u0026ldquo;World Safe\u0026rdquo; mode (01) which only permits channels 1–11.\nIf your target network is on channel 12, 13, or 14, you must set the correct country code first.\nFix via on-device UI:\nOpen Menu → Settings → WiFi Country. Select your region. Restart the device.
