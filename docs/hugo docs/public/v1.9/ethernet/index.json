GhostESP scans for common protocols to build a device profile.\nOverview\rWhen you run a fingerprint scan, GhostESP listens for network traffic and service announcements to identify devices. It looks for:\nmDNS — Service announcements (printers, speakers, etc.) NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service) — Windows device name broadcasts SSDP — UPnP device announcements The scan collects device names, IP addresses, detected device types (Chromecast, Roku, Apple, Samsung, etc.), and service information.\nPrerequisites\rA Banshee device with Ethernet connected Access to the device via GhostLink display menu or terminal A network with active devices How to Use\rVia Terminal\rRun the fingerprint scan from the terminal:\nethfp The scan will run for approximately 3 seconds and display discovered devices with their details:\nIP Address: 192.168.1.100\rDevice Name: Living-Room-TV\rDevice Type: Samsung\rService: upnp Via GhostLink Display Menu\rConnect to the Banshee device via GhostLink Navigate to Ethernet menu Select Fingerprint Scan Wait for the scan to complete (approximately 3 seconds) View the list of discovered devices Understanding Results\rEach discovered device shows:\nIP Address — The device\u0026rsquo;s IP on the network Device Name — Hostname or friendly name if available Device Type — Detected manufacturer or device category (Samsung, Apple, Google, etc.) Service Type — Protocol used for detection (mDNS, SSDP, NBNS) OS Info — Operating system or device model if detected Troubleshooting\rNo devices found: Ensure devices are powered on and on the same network. Some devices don\u0026rsquo;t broadcast. Incomplete information: Not all devices provide full details. GhostESP shows what it can detect from available network traffic. Timeout: The scan runs for 3 seconds. If you need more time, run the scan again.
