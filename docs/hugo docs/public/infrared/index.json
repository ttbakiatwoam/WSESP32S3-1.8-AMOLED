[{"content":" Before you start Hardware: Use a board with IR RX support (see hardware requirements). SD card: Inserted and mounted so GhostESP can save .ir files under /ghostesp/infrared/. Easy Learn: Optional assistant that suggests button names; toggle it via infrared_easy in the command line config or the settings menu. Learn a remote or button Open the Infrared view from the main menu and choose Learn Remote for a new file or Learn Button inside a saved remote to append a new signal to an existing remote.\nAlign the source remote with the IR receiver window, hold it steady within a few centimeters, then press the button once.\nConfirm the button name. Easy Learn provides a suggested label during learning, otherwise use the on-screen keyboard.\nWatch the preview popup for carrier frequency, protocol name, and decoded address/command details. Cancel and retry if you recieve a raw decode on a known non-raw signal.\nConfirm to save. GhostESP will create a new .ir file for fresh remotes or append the button to the currently open file automatically.\nStorage layout New remotes are written to /ghostesp/infrared/remotes/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.ir. Adding to an existing remote appends another named button block inside the same .ir file. Tips Keep the remote within a few centimeters of the receiver and avoid direct sunlight. If learning fails, exit and re-open the Infrared view to reinitialize the RMT RX channel. Large universal files can consume RAM; learn and save remotes in smaller groups if you run into memory warnings.

Pick a Flipper-compatible .ir file. GhostESP parses the sections inside the file and lists every named button. Tap a button entry to transmit. The configured LED should flash pink if not in stealth mode. Universal libraries Universal .ir packs live under /ghostesp/infrared/universals and contain large collections of commands grouped by device. When you open a universal file, GhostESP scans the command list and prompts you to pick a specific button to send. Parsing very large libraries (for example, community dumps) can take several seconds; wait for the list to finish populating before selecting. You can find supported universals at Momentum Flipper Firmware. Download and place the files under infrared/universals. Tips Aim the device’s IR LED directly at the target device’s receiver window and stay within a few meters. If nothing happens, close the popup, verify you chose the right protocol (raw vs decoded), and relearn the button or test another signal. Ensure no bright sunlight hits the receiver; ambient infrared noise can reduce range. ","description":"Send captured or universal IR commands","permalink":"/infrared/transmitting/","title":"Transmitting Signals"},{"content":" Directory layout /ghostesp/infrared/remotes holds individual remotes captured on-device. /ghostesp/infrared/universals stores library files with many commands. The Infrared UI reads from /mnt/ghostesp/infrared/... when the SD card is mounted. Flipper IR libraries GhostESP reads the standard Flipper .ir format, so you can copy files from community packs. A large collection is available at Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB; place downloaded files under infrared/universals for universal files or infrared/remotes. Append new signals Choose Add Signal while a remote is open to append a newly learned button. Easy Learn suggests button names; otherwise you will be prompted via the on-screen keyboard. Web UI management Connect to the GhostNet AP and open the web UI. Browse to the file manager and navigate to /ghostesp/infrared/. Upload .ir files to the appropriate folder or download existing ones for backups. Tips Keep file names short; the UI truncates long names in lists. After mass uploads, reload the Infrared view to refresh the cache. Back up your IR folder before flashing new firmware or reformatting the SD card.

Look for infrared support listed in the release notes or above before flashing.\nWiring and Developer notes IR LED: Connected to the configured TX pin (CONFIG_INFRARED_LED_PIN). Ensure correct polarity and a current-limiting resistor if you add an external LED. IR Receiver: Required for learning. Boards with CONFIG_HAS_INFRARED_RX set expose the pin via CONFIG_INFRARED_RX_PIN. Power and positioning Keep the LED unobstructed; align it with the target device for reliable transmission. For learning, place the source remote close to the receiver window and shield it from direct sunlight or fluorescent flicker.
