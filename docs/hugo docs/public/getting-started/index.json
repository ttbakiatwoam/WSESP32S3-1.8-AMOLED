[{"content":" Prerequisites Before starting, make sure you have:\nA compatible ESP32 board (see Supported Hardware) A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Brave, or Microsoft Edge is recommended, as Firefox doesn\u0026rsquo;t support WebSerial) An appropriate USB cable (Micro USB or USB-C, ensure it\u0026rsquo;s a data cable, not a charge-only cable) File Extraction Tool: Install 7-Zip or a similar program for extracting .zip bundles. Note\nFor best results, disable any VPN or firewall that might block the flashing process, as some network configurations may interfere with the web flasher.\nFlashing Methods Choose your preferred method:\nWeb Flasher Method (Recommended) USB Connection Method Flipper Zero Method (Doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a PC) Web Flasher Method Prepare\nOpen flasher.ghostesp.net in Chrome. Close apps using the serial port. If the site glitches, clear cache. Enter Bootloader\nHold BOOT → plug USB → release. If needed: hold BOOT, tap RESET, keep holding BOOT 1–2 s, release. Flash\nPick your the ESP32 variant your board uses, click Connect, and follow the prompts. Verify\nUnplug and replug. Continue with Post-Installation. Tips: After flashing, you may need to restart the device to initialize the new firmware. To ensure a clean start, disconnect and reconnect your ESP32.\nUSB Connection Method Use when selecting files and offsets manually.\nDownload\nGet firmware from GhostESP Releases. Extract the .zip with your preferred tool. Connect\nEnter bootloader Hold BOOT → plug USB → release. If needed: hold BOOT, tap RESET, keep holding BOOT 1–2 s, release. Flash via ESP Huhn Tool\nClick Connect, select the COM port labeled with your chipset. Load binaries with offsets: Chip family bootloader.bin partitions.bin (Partition table) firmware.bin (GhostESP_IDF) ESP32-S2 and similar 0x1000 0x8000 0x10000 ESP32-S3 / C3 / C6 0x0 0x8000 0x10000 Click Flash and wait. Verify\nReplug the board and connect to a serial console to see logs from your device. Flipper Zero Method Download\nInstall GhostESP app (.fap) from the Flipper app store\nor releases. Download firmware from GhostESP Releases. Prepare\nExtract archives. Choose the firmware that matches your chip\n(e.g., Flipper Dev Board = ESP32-S2 generic). Copy to Flipper\nUse qFlipper (either the mobile app or the desktop app) or pull out the sd card and use the sd card directly. Put the .bin files in SDCard/apps_data/esp_flasher/. Do not use assets/. Connect Hardware\nWire ESP32 to Flipper GPIO. Enter bootloader (see Web Flasher Method). Flash on Flipper\nOpen ESP flasher → Manual Flash. Select bootloader.bin, partitions.bin, GhostESP.bin and make sure to check the option if your device is one of the specified variants. Start flash. Reset the ESP32 when done. Post-Installation As soon as the flash finishes, GhostESP boots its default access point so you can pick the control surface that fits your hardware and workflow.\nControl Options Web Interface\nConnect to the GhostNet AP with the password GhostNet Open a browser and connect to either ghostesp.local (requires mDNS support) or 192.168.4.1 to access device settings. Sign in with the default credentials GhostNet / GhostNet. Run webauth off in the serial/Web CLI if you want to disable the WebUI authentication. Use the auto-updating configuration panel to manage settings, Evil Portal controls, and device info. Qt6 Control App\nDownload and install the Qt6-based desktop application for more advanced control options. Offers access to advanced features, customizable settings, and an improved interface for interacting with GhostESP. Serial Command Line\nConnect via a serial interface for direct command-line control. Provides full access to GhostESP\u0026rsquo;s command suite and is ideal for advanced users or troubleshooting. Refer to the Command Line Reference for available commands and examples. Android devices can interface with the serial command line directly using the Serial USB Terminal app Flipper Zero App\nControl GhostESP directly from the Flipper Zero. Now available directly from the official flipper app store! Ensure you have the latest .fap version on your Flipper Zero for full functionality and access to features like Evil Portal, Wi-Fi control, and more. Touch Screen Interface (for supported boards)\nNavigate through menus using touch gestures Access all major features through the graphical interface Terminal App available for keyboard-based command input on boards with keyboards Common Installation Issues Boot loops: Usually power or board-target mismatches—verify you flashed the right image and try a known-good USB-C cable. Flash errors: Ensure the chip is in bootloader mode; swap USB ports or hubs if esptool.py times out. Connection issues: Install the correct USB-to-UART driver (CP210x, CH34x, etc.) before expecting the web UI or CLI to appear. Power brownouts: Radio-heavy workloads spike draw, so use a stable 5 V supply or powered hub. Browser cache conflicts: If the web flasher misbehaves, clear cached site data or switch to a fresh browser session. Troubleshooting Tip: When flashing from the Flipper Zero app, double-check GPIO wiring and confirm every firmware blob lives under SDCard/apps_data/esp_flasher/ before you start the transfer.\n","description":"Instructions for installing GhostESP firmware on ESP32 devices","permalink":"/getting-started/installation-guide/","title":"Installation Guide"},{"content":"GhostESP runs on a range of ESP32 development boards and consumer devices.

","description":"Common GhostESP CLI commands grouped by task.","permalink":"/getting-started/command-line-reference/","title":"Command Line Reference"},{"content":" Frequently Asked Questions 1. What are the default network credentials? SSID: GhostNet Password: GhostNet 2. What are the default credentials for the web interface? Username: GhostNet Password: GhostNet 3. How do I access the web interface? Connect to the GhostNet WiFi network. Open your browser and visit: ghostesp.local or 192.168.4.1 4. Why don’t the default credentials work for the web interface? The web interface uses the same credentials as your WiFi AP. If you’ve changed your WiFi SSID or password, your web interface credentials also change. Note\nThe firmware has a subtle password-length mismatch: the AP code falls back to the default password unless the saved password is longer than 8 characters, while web authentication treats passwords of length 8 as valid. If you set an exactly 8-character password you may see the web UI and AP use different credentials; use a password longer than 8 characters to avoid this.\n5. How do I flash my board? See the Installation Guide. Use the web flasher at: https://flasher.ghostesp.net/ 6. Can I upload custom Evil Portal HTML over Serial or from my Flipper Zero? SD Card: Place custom HTML in /ghostesp/evil_portal/portals on your SD card. Flipper Zero App: You can upload simple HTML (max 2048 bytes) directly via the app (v1.4+ and firmware v1.7+). 7. My board isn’t currently supported. Will you add support? Unless something is said otherwise, no. Feel free to do it yourself—we accept and appreciate PRs. 8. Why does my connection to the GhostESP AP drop when issuing WiFi commands? The ESP32 can’t operate as both an Access Point and WiFi Client at the same time. Switching modes will disconnect your device from the AP. 9. I’m not seeing any output when connecting via Serial. The firmware is silent unless a command is running. Try sending the help command to verify your connection or reconnecting; sometimes you will have a bad connection. 10. Why won’t my SD card work? \u0026ldquo;Generic\u0026rdquo; firmware builds include SD card support by default; use sd_config to see the pins or sd_pins_spi \u0026lt;cs\u0026gt; \u0026lt;clk\u0026gt; \u0026lt;miso\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mosi\u0026gt; to set SPI pins and sd_save_config to save the pin config to SD card. Ensure your SD card is formatted as FAT32. Try using a SanDisk brand SD card 32GB or less.
